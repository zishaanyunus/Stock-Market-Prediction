# Stock-Market-Prediction
This project was an attempt to determine the future prices of the stocks of a company with greater accuracy and reliability using machine learning techniques. The application of the novel LSTM Model as a means of determining the stock prices. Both the techniques have shown an improvement in the accuracy of predictions, thereby yielding positive results with the LSTM model proving to be more efficient. The results are quite promising and has led to the conclusion that it is possible to predict stock market with more accuracy and efficiency using machine learning techniques. In the future, the accuracy of the stock market prediction system can be further improved by utilising a much bigger dataset than the one being utilised currently.
